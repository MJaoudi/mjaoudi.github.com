            <h3>NYU Bus Tracker</h3>
            <p>The NYU Bus Tracker is an app designed to help students use the NYU buses. It takes real-time bus locations and combines them with scheduled departure times that the university provides. All of the times I reformatted and stored remotely. Every time the app starts up, it checks for changes in the times and seamlessly updates them. Northbound and southbound stops are presented as two stops by the real-time API but are presented to the user as one stop. The app can determine if they intended to use the northbound or southbound bus. The same stops on multiple routes are also combined. All of these things can be configured remotely so the app doesn't need to be updated for every little change. This is all to make a clean and easy experience for the user. The app is also fully functional without an internet connection. This app was developed at the beginning of my Junior year of college.</p>

              <p>Snakez is the classic Snake game upgraded for the iPhone and iPad. What makes it unique is a head-to-head multiplayer mode over Bluetooth. It was built on top of <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">cocos2d</a>. Snakez was developed in my Freshman year of college. And it is free!</p>

                <h3>FencingRef</h3>
                <p>FencingRef is an iPhone app designed to help Fencing referees judge a fencing match. Referees would normally use a printed out scoresheet and write down points and penalties on there. Then they have to do various calculations by hand. They would use a separate device to keep track of the time. This app was designed to provide a streamlined and efficient way for referees to run and record fencing matches. FencingRef was the first app I ever created. It was originally created in my later years of High School.</p>
